# neovim configuration

As minimalist, simple and refined as possible. The goal is to have every line explained in a commit and use as much of vanilla vim features as possible. This way when viewing blame for the config file every line is explained and commented without having to comment the config files themselves.  

Remember to `git clone --recursive` :wink:
